                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
                        learning from their experiences was easy.
                        
                        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
